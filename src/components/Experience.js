        <h4>Web Developer</h4>
        <p>
          As a web developer, my main responsibility was working on the
          development of frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          Over the past year, I frequently transitioned into backend
          development, using PHP, which allowed me to gain broader experience in
          creating complete web solutions. I developed websites using custom
          themes, writing the entire code from scratch. In close collaboration
          with designers, I created pixel-perfect websites, ensuring
          responsiveness and SEO optimization, delivering both technically and
          visually optimized projects.
